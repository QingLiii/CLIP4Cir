Richard Bright (1789-1858), whose surname is pronounced in the usual way, was born in Bristol, United Kingdom, qualified in medicine in Edinburgh, and became a physician at Guys Hospital at the same time as Addison and Hodgkin, who also had diseases named after them. In 1827, Bright published a book called Reports of medical cases selected with a view of illustrating the symptoms and cure of diseases by a reference to morbid anatomy. He showed the association of edema, then called anasarca or dropsy or dropsical affection, with proteinuria and disorders of the kidney, and separated edema due to renal disorders from edema due to diseases of the heart and liver.

Virchow apparently pronounced his surname feer-cho, with the ch as the Scottish pronounce it in loch, but several other pronunciations are used in English. The word amyloid was first used by two Germans J Vogel and M J Schleiden in 1839, because of the similar staining properties of cellulose and starch.

Immunohistologic study showed mesangial deposition of IgA, and gave the diagnosis of Henoch-Schönlein nephritis. Glomerular changes are illustrated at higher magnification in 7.26. The names are often pronounced hee-nock and shern-line. What is now usually called Henoch-Schönlein purpura was first given the name Schönlein-Henoch syndrome in 1948. Sometimes, in English, Schönlein is spelled Schoenlein to avoid use of the umlaut symbol. He preceded Henoch, but now follows him in the name of this disease. Eduard Heinrich Henoch (1820-1910) was born in Berlin, and was a pupil of Schönlein, as was Virchow (4.5). In 1868, Henoch, who was what would now be called a pediatrician, described children with attacks of purpura, joint pains, intestinal colic, and intestinal hemorrhage. He later added the association with renal disease. Johann Lukas Schönlein (1793-1864) was Professor of Pathology and Therapy in Würzburg, and then Professor of Medicine in Zurich and Berlin. His accounts of an illness with joint pains and a rash were given in various editions of a textbook written by students based on his lectures. In the 1834 edition, Schönlein mentioned oliguria as a finding in the condition. The first report of the finding of IgA in glomeruli in Henoch-Schönlein nephritis seems to have been in 1968, although the significance of this was overlooked by the authors.There is a strong chance that the composer W A Mozart (1756-1791) had Henoch-Schönlein purpura as a boy, and died of renal failure when he was 35"

Although monoclonal light chains in the urine are called Bence Jones proteins, pronounced benss and jones in the usual way, the name should be Jones proteins, or even MacIntyre proteins. Henry Bence Jones (1813-1873) did not hyphenate his name and was called Jones. He qualified in medicine at St Georges Hospital in London, United Kingdom, where he became a physician, and specialised in what would now be called clinical chemistry. In 1847 and 1848, he reported an unusual protein in the urine of a man aged 45, under the care of Dr Thomas Watson and Dr William MacIntyre. The properties of the urine were discovered by MacIntyre in 1845, but not published by him until 1850. Myeloma was named in 1873, and its relation to Joness proteinuria was noted in 1889.

This is not normal on orthodox light microscopy, and has a little chronic damage with many foamy cells, probably both in tubules and in interstitial tissues.

Alports syndrome was suggested by R F Shaw and R A Glover in 1961 as a suitable name for the condition of familial renal disease with deafness, to honour Cecil Alport who described a family in 1927 (Alport AC. Hereditary familial congenital haemorrhagic nephritis. British Medical Journal 1927; 1: 504-506). The name is pronounced awl-port or al-port. Arthur Cecil Alport (1880-1959) was born in South Africa, and qualified in medicine in Edinburgh, United Kingdom. In 1922, he was appointed second assistant to the medical unit at St Marys Hospital Medical School in London, which he left in 1937 to become professor of medicine in Cairo, Egypt. The family he described had already been reported four times, by L G Guthrie in 1902, G Kendall and A F Hertz in 1912, Hertz again in 1923 but after a change of surname to Hurst, and J Eason, G L M Smith and G Buchanan in 1924. The observation had been made that males were more affected than females, but Alport was the first to mention deafness in the family. In 1968, M D Crawford and P J Toghill reported that they had traced the family described by Alport, and found that the disease had disappeared from it. The characteristic changes in glomerular basement membranes were first described in 1972. Electron microscopy was never done on glomeruli in Alports family"

In 1968, Jean Berger (born 1930), Professor of Pathology at the Necker Hospital in Paris, France, with his colleague Nicole Hinglais, who was an electron microscopist, reported the finding of IgA by immunofluorescence in 25 renal biopsy specimens. This was in a note of six short paragraphs, with no references (Berger J, Hinglais N. Les dépôts intercapillaires dIgA-IgG. Journal dUrologie et de Nephrologie 1968; 74: 694-695). This tiny paper was largely overlooked, and the significance of IgA deposition in glomeruli did not become widely appreciated until 1969, when Berger presented his findings at a meeting of the Transplantation Society (Berger J. IgA glomerular deposits in renal disease. Transplantation Proceedings 1969; 1: 939-944). The terms Bergers disease and Bergers nephropathy seem to have been first used in print in 1973.

There is expansion of the mesangium with formation of Kimmelstiel-Wilson nodules, typical of diabetic glomerulopathy. Kimmelstiel, usually pronounced kimul-steel in English, and Wilson, pronounced in the usual way, described the postmortem kidneys of eight adults, seven of whom were known to have had diabetes mellitus. They found hyaline masses in the glomerular intercapillary tissue, now called the mesangium. They called this intercapillary glomerulosclerosis, but did not use the word nodule (Kimmelstiel P, Wilson C. Intercapillary lesions in the glomeruli of the kidney. American Journal of Pathology 1936; 12: 83-97). Nodule, coming from the Latin for a little knot, was in use by 1948, and the term Kimmelstiel-Wilson lesion was in use by 1951, although who was the first to think of these is difficult to discover. In Latin, the word diabetes meant a passing through or a siphon, and mellitus meant honeyed or sweet. Paul Kimmelstiel (1900-1970) was born in Hamburg, Germany, and became a pathologist there in the department of Theodor Fahr, who with the physician Franz Volhard was important in the development of understanding of the kidney through their clinicopathologic studies, first published in 1914. Kimmelstiel began to study glomerular lesions, but was forced to leave Germany in 1933 by the Nazis, and went to the United States. Clifford Wilson (1906-1997) qualified in medicine at the London Hospital, United Kingdom. In 1934, he went to Harvard University as a Rockefeller Travelling Fellow and met Kimmelstiel, who was an instructor in the Mallory Institute of Pathology. Later, Kimmelstiel worked as a pathologist in several cities in the United States. Wilson became Professor of Medicine at the London Hospital in 1946, succeeding Arthur William Mickle Ellis (1883-1966). Ellis developed a classification of renal disease that was influential for many years. In this, there were only two numbered types of"

In 1958, M C Stanton and J D Tange suggested the name Goodpastures syndrome for the combination of pulmonary hemorrhage and glomerulonephritis, and they took no notice of the vasculitis in the spleen and intestine in the man reported by Goodpasture. Later, the term Goodpastures disease began to be applied when Goodpastures syndrome was associated with antiglomerular basement membrane antibodies, after linear deposition of IgG in glomerular basement membranes was reported in 1964.

Vascular access to allow hemodialysis was becoming so difficult that a cadaveric kidney was accepted for transplantation, even though the recipient had antibodies to HLA class two antigens in the donor. With extra immunosuppression at transplantation, graft function was satisfactory until 9 days after transplantation, when there was a swollen, tender kidney with oliguria and a marked rise in serum creatinine concentration. Biopsy was not done at that time, because there was a fear of rupture of the graft. Intensive treatment for presumed antibody-mediated rejection produced clinical improvement in symptoms, but not in renal function. The biopsy specimen is stained by an immunohistologic method for C4d, and shows extensive deposition in the endothelium of intertubular capillaries, but without any other evidence of rejection. The graft recovered function without additional treatment"

There is no acute or chronic tubular damage. Glomeruli have pure membranous nephropathy as a sign of lupus nephritis. In Latin, the word lupus meant a wolf. In English, the word was used for many centuries to mean a skin ulcer. This was well defined by Barrough in 1590: Lupus is a malignant ulcer quickly consuming the neather parts; and it is very hungry like unto a woolfe. Different types of ulcer became recognised, such as lupus vulgaris caused by tuberculosis. The name systemic lupus erythematosus had this basis rather than other suggested origins, such as the supposed resemblance of the facial rash to a wolfs face. Systemic lupus erythematosus is thought to have caused renal failure and death in the American writers Jack London (1876-1916) and Flannery OConnor (1925-1964), and the ruler of the Philippines, Ferdinand Marcos (1917-1989), who died after two renal allografts"

Patterns 1 and 2 occasionally exist on prostate transurethral resection (TURP) and in multifocal low-grade tumors in radical prostatectomy specimens. Due to poor reproducibility, lack of good correlation with prostatectomy grade, sampling issues, and potentially misleading clinical implications, Gleason score of 3 on needle biopsy should rarely, if ever be made only when all strict criteria are met and adenosis is excluded. A major limitation of assigning a Gleason pattern 1 or 2 on a needle biopsy is that one may not see the border of the entire lesion as shown in this example. Therefore, most of such lesions in NBX should be assigned a score of 3 + 3 = 6. A score of 3 + 2 = 5 or 2 + 3 = 5 may be assigned with a comment that the Gleason score in radical prostatectomy is almost always higher in such a case"
